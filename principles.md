# Aside principles

**Radically private**  
**Radically minimal**  
**Radically open**

---

### Radically private
- True peer-to-peer  
- No servers  
- No history  
- No logs  
- No logos  
- No app stores  
- No notifications  

Privacy isn’t a feature. It’s the baseline.

---

### Radically minimal
- It’s not what we add—it’s what we remove  
- It’s not what it is—it’s what it isn’t  
- Powered directly by protocol—no extra layers, no added complexity  
- No onboarding. No growth loops.

Minimalism isn’t an aesthetic. It’s a language.

---

### Radically open
- Open thinking  
- Open design  
- Open code  

This isn’t just open-source. It’s open-intent.
