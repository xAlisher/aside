## Why Aside exists

Aside is not a product. It’s an answer to the moment when someone says:
**“I can’t say this here.”**

It’s not a feature.
It’s not a product-market fit.
It’s a response—a quiet, permissionless exit gesture that doesn’t require approval.

Most tools are designed to retain, monetize, and analyze.  
Aside is designed to **disappear**.

## What Aside believes

- **Silence is a valid mode of communication.**  
- **Privacy should not require explanation.**  
- **Ephemerality is a feature, not a flaw.**  
- **One message at the right time is more powerful than a thousand stored forever.**  
- **We don’t need to replace mainstream apps. We need ways to step outside them.**

## What Aside refuses

- No accounts  
- No history  
- No logs  
- No tracking  
- No growth strategy  
- No roadmap toward stickiness

This is not a safe space. It’s a **quiet one**.

## Forks welcome

This is a baseline.  
Build on it. Strip it down further.  
Use it in the open, or keep it buried until you need it.

If it disappears, it worked.
